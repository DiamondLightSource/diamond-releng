First install OS of choice to make the clean snapshot
 * This snapshot makes it a little easier than reinstalling the OS from scratch,
   it is particularly useful for Windows where starting from this point for future
   work is less likely to cause Activation issues.
- You can use VMWare quick install where it is helpful
- Set user name to tester
  * Note on some of the older existing installs, the clean snapshots may
    have a user name of "Diamond Tester" on Windows
- Set password to kesd-2ls-3s=Qq
- Set/check keyboard layout (especially needed if using quick install in VMWare)
  * Make sure to apply change system wide if appropriate
- Set networking to anything needed, the "base" snapshot locks
  it down to host only
- Activate Windows if needed
- Install VMWare tools
- Shutdown the VM
- Snapshot it as "clean_shutdown"

- set a fixed ip address 172.16.66.xx
- fixed DNS server 172.16.77.2

Create the "base" and "base_shutdown" snapshots.
 * The "base" snapshot is used to run the tests. At the high level it needs
   to have the OS fully installed, with sudo (or equivalent) permission to
   the tester user and have an SSH server installed to receive connections.
- Set/check keyboard layout (especially needed if using quick install in VMWare)
  * Make sure to apply change system wide if appropriate
- Give admin's on the machine unprompted root access
  * Linux: Add NOPASSWD to admin group in sudoers
    - sudo -E visudo
    - change line to have NOPASSWD, e.g.:
      = %admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
      = %sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
  * Windows 7: Change UAC to none 
    - Press Start | type UAC
    - Click "Change User Account Control settings"
    - Drag slider to the bottom "Never Notify"
    
- Install all desired updates and turn off update manager (to avoid unnecessary pop-ups)
  * Remember to check for new updates, may require a reload of the databases
  * Make sure to turn all updates off, including upgrades
- Turn off screensavers/powersave/autolock and anything else that pops up etc
  * On ubuntu 12.04 it appears to only be possible to turn off screensaver/lock at command line:
    - gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver idle-activation-enabled false
    - gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled false
    - see http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/04/disable-screensaver-black-screen-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/ and
      http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/04/disable-screensaver-lock-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/
  * Ubunutu 12.04 also nags about backup, turn that off too
    - You should be prompted about it shortly after logging on
- Install SSH Server
  * Test SSH installation with this command line:
    ssh -i utils/id_rsa -F /dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null tester@"ip address of guest"
  Linux: 
    * Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
      - Turn off reverse DNS on login by adding "UseDNS no"
        to the end of /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        Without this change each ssh connection takes many seconds
        and it is not useful on a host only network
      - Restart ssh server: sudo ssh restart
    * Copy utils/id_rsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (with perm 600)
  Windows: 
    * Install freeSSHd http://www.freesshd.com/
    * Don't us the service to start freesshd. Add it to the Startup programs group
      This is so the server runs as the interactive user under the tester account
    * Turn off updates in freeSSHd
    * Create a "tester" ssh account (Users tab)
      Give the tester Public key authorization and allow shell, sftp and tunneling
    * Copy utils/id_rsa.pub to C:\Program Files\freeSSHd\tester
      NOTE1 the tester file must not have an extension
      NOTE2 the exact location is set by Public key folder 
            location in freesshd Authentication tab
    * Set SFTP home path (SFTP tab) to C:\ to allow access to entire drive
- Enable VNC Server in VMWare
  * set the password to squish
  * Use a free port between 5901 and 5999 (inclusive)
  * To determine what ports are in use, try "grep vnc.port */*.vmx"
  * This port is also used for IP address assignment in the scripts
    See vmoptions.sh:vm_setup_ip() where the lowest to characters of the port 
    are used as the last byte of the guest IP address.
- Linux only: install subversion:
  * sudo apt-get install subversion

  * svn up # create default ~/.subversion/
  * add to ~/.subversion/config [auth] section:
    # Eclipse SVN plugin (subclipse) generates a big
    # warning about password stores unless this
    # line is in the config
    password-stores = 
  * NOTE that since updates to svn this may not be necessary.
- Windows Only items:
  * Turn off Network Location Wizard
    - Apply the reg file (utils/network_location_wizard_off.reg)
    - see http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg252535, the instructions
      apply equally to Windows 7. 
  * Copy 7-Zip command line to c:\scratch
    - 7z.exe is expected to be C:\scratch\7z.exe (with 7z.dll too)
    - Get 7-zip from http://www.7-zip.org/
    - Run installer on any windows machine
    - Copy 7z.exe and 7z.dll to C:\scratch
  * turn off the Windows firewall
  * turn off action centre notifications for everything
  * set problem reporting settings to never check for solutions
    - On Windows 7 this is next to other action centre items
    - On Windows XP this is in System properties, Advanced Tab, 
      Error Reporting button
  * also set date/time/region, and make sure daylight saving change not notified
  * turn off auto-defragment
  
- Make scratch location
  * Linux: sudo mkdir /scratch ; sudo chown tester:tester /scratch
  * Windows: Make C:\scratch and ensure readable/writable by tester
  
- turn on Host only network in VMWare
- Reinstall VMWare tools 
  * This may be optional under some conditions, but especially needed
    if linux kernel got upgraded

- How to make configuration changes made to base_shutdown after it was originally created
  * rename base_shutdown to base_shutdown_original
  * select base_shutdown_original, "go to snapshot", 
  * edit the VM settings
    - memory to 4GB
    - delete CD/DVD 2 if it exists
    - turn OFF "connect at power on" for Floppy, and Printer (very important)
      (if the printer is connected, we get repeated "CUPS interface problem, adaptor daemon restart..." messages)
    - turn ON "accelerate 3D graphics"
    - turn OFF USB Controller "Automatically connect" and "share Bluetooth"
  * update the VM
     - in VM settings, temporarily change network adapter to "NAT"
     - boot machine, log in as "tester"
     - set proxy (you can leave this setting permanently)
     - change desktop to solid colour
     - run update manager
     - apply fix for Ubunutu 10.04
       grep 'trough-under-steppers' /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
       sudo sed --in-place 's/GtkRange::trough-under-steppers = 0/GtkRange::trough-under-steppers = 1/' /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
     - turn off unnecessary stuff in Startup Programs
     - reinstall VM tools (say NO to shared folders; all other defaults ok); reboot
     - run disk cleanup; empty the rubbish bin
     - sudo apt-get autoremove
     - power down VM
     - change network adapter to "Host-only"
     - power on the VM to make sure it's ok (no need to log in), then power off
  * Take a snapshot as base_shutdown
  * proceed as below

- Shutdown machine
- snapshot the shutdown machine as "base_shutdown"
  * Startup the VM and logon
  * Ensure the window/screen size is sufficient before snapshotting
  * (Optional, linux) run some commands so if you VNC in you can get indication of 
    what is happening. On linux machine you can open two terminals with 
    the following commands
    - watch "ls -l --si -S /scratch"
    - tail --retry --follow=name /scratch/log
    
  * (Optional, Windows 7) open Windows Explorer looking at C:\scratch
  * On Windows you may need to reboot if the hardware has changed
  * On Windows after logging in, wait a little while (minute or two) before
    snapshotting so that all startup has completed
  * Create the running snapshot, called "base"
